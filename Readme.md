# ðŸ”¬ ðŸ’¡ Enderscope Microscopy Adaptation ðŸ’¡ ðŸ”¬

## About
This project is an adaptation of the [original EnderScope project](https://github.com/Pickering-Lab/EnderScope), specifically optimized for epifluorescence microscopy with a 10X objective. While the original EnderScope transforms an Ender 3D printer into a versatile imaging system, this adaptation focuses on biological applications and microscopy capabilities.

## Original Project Credit
This work is based on the EnderScope project developed by the Pickering Lab. The original project can be found at: 
- [Github](https://github.com/Pickering-Lab/EnderScope)
- [Realted publication](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2023.0214)

## Modifications and Improvements
This adaptation includes:
- Specialized setup for epifluorescence microscopy
- Optimized for 10X objective use
- Enhanced biological sample imaging capabilities
- Custom Python scripts for microscopy-specific functions

## Installation and Setup
1. Print the necessary 3D parts (files available in the `3D_pieces` directory)
2. Assemble the system according to the assembly guide (coming soon...)
3. Configure the Raspberry Pi
4. Install the required Python dependencies


## Python dependencies
```bash
pip install board
pip install serial
pip install neopixel
```

## Usage
```python

# Initialize components
from EnderMain import Panel, Stage
from EnderPiCam import EnderPiCam
from EnderPiLight import EnderPiLight

stage = Stage(port='/dev/ttyUSB1', baud_rate=115200)
camera = EnderPiCam(title="HQ-CAM")
excitation_light = EnderPiLight(title="Excitation Light", board_pin=board.D18, total_pixels=1, start_pin=0, end_pin=1)

panel = Panel(stage, [camera, excitation_light])


# Launch interface
panel.display()
```

## Available Modules
- **Stage**: Motorized movement control
